The top-level directory "data" contains the following structure:

data/
`-- english
    |-- annotations
    |   |-- bc
    |   |   `-- cnn
    |   |       `-- 00
    |   |-- bn
    |   |   `-- abc
    |   |       `-- 00
    |   |-- nw
    |   |   `-- wsj
    |   |       `-- 00
    |   `-- wb
    |       `-- eng
    |           `-- 00
    `-- metadata
        |-- frames
        `-- sense-inventories


The "annotations" directory contains a sub-directory for each genre.

bc: Broadcast Conversation
bn: Broadcast News
nw: Newswire
wb: Web (Blogs and Newsgroups)

Under each genre directory there is a directory for the source, which
itself contains sections -- each containing at most 100 files.

There are several annotation layers that are separate files per
document:

   .parse: Treebank-style parse trees
    .prop: PropBank-style propositions
   .sense: Word Sense
.parallel: Pointer to the parallel file (if any)
 .speaker: Speaker information for each sentence (or tree)
   .coref: Coreference

There is also some metadata that is required to interpret the sense
and proposition layers. These are the "frames" and "sense-inventory"
directories.
